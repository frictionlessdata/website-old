## Technical Partners

[![rOpenSci](/img/partners/ropensci.png)](https://ropensci.org/)

**rOpenSci** is a collaborative effort to develop R-based tools for
facilitating Open Science. It develops open source R packages that
provide programmatic access to a variety of scientific data, full-text
of journal articles, and repositories that provide real-time metrics
of scholarly impact.

rOpenSci are the maintainers of the official R libraries for (Tabular)
Data Packages and will be the steward of these R libraries.

[![ODI](/img/partners/odi.png)](http://www.opendata.institute)

The **ODI** was co-founded in 2012 to address today’s global
challenges using the web of data. It brings together commercial and
non-commercial organisations and governments to equip and inspire
people around the world to innovate with Data.

The ODI are the official maintainers of the Ruby libraries and we will
collaborate on a number of tools for sharing and working with data.

[![PNNL](/img/partners/pnnl.png)](http://www.pnnl.gov/)

**Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)** is one of the United
States Department of Energy national laboratories, managed by the
Department of Energy's Office of Science. PNNL scientists conduct
basic and applied research and development to strengthen
U.S. scientific foundations for fundamental research and innovation.

Open Knowledge International will be piloting some tools and work on
fixes and enhancements to specific use cases within the PNNL
workflow. Work will include the integration of Good Tables for data
validation on repositories that are used by the Active Data app and
piloting some tools for editing data directly.

## Pilot Partners

[![TEDDINET/DM4T](/img/partners/teddinet.png)](http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/dm4t/index.shtml)

**Data Management for TEDDINET (DM4T)** is set up to support TEDDINET
(Transforming Energy Demand through Digital Innovation Network)
collectively to construct a data legacy for the TEDDI, BuildTEDDI and
the non-domestic buildings programmes as a whole.

Open Knowledge International and DM4T will work together on a
proof-of-concept pilot around data management using the Frictionless
Data tools and specifications.

**Stephen Eglen**, a Reader in Computational Neuroscience at the
University of Cambridge, is working with us to investigate the
applicability of the Data Package concept to facilitate data reuse.

Together, we are trialling tools for packaging and reading nervous
system data using R.

[![UPCUSR](/img/partners/upcusr.png)](http://ucsur.pitt.edu/)

**The Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center** provides a shared
technological and legal infrastructure to support research, analysis,
decision making, and community engagement.

We will be working with the University of Pittsburgh Center for Urban
and Social Research to pilot a number of frictionless data tools on
the portal including the Data Quality Dashboard, GoodTables and
integrations with CKAN.

[![Dataship](/img/partners/dataship.png)](https://dataship.io/)

**Dataship** is a way to share data and analysis, from simple charts
to complex machine learning, with anyone in the world easily and for
free. It allows the creation of notebooks that hold and deliver your
data, as well as text, images and inline scripts for doing analysis
and visualization.

Data Package is the native format for the Dataship notebook.
Together, we have published the following
[Case Study](/case-studies/dataship/) documenting the use of the
Frictionless Data specifications in this tool.
