title: Get Involved
---

<p>Frictionless Data is a major project of <a href="https://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge International</a> which started as a <em>community-driven</em> effort of <a href="http://okfnlabs.org">Open Knowledge Labs</a>.  Community building continues to be a core component of the project: <strong>anyone can get involved and contributions are very welcome</strong>.</p>

<p>In order to make creating, using, and sharing data as easy and frictionless as possible, we need <strong>concrete use cases</strong> and <strong>feedback</strong> from people working across a variety of data-intensive fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are you a researcher that needs a specific <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tools/">tool or integration with your existing software</a> to do your work more effectively?  
  <li>Are you a developer working on tooling and have features that our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/standards/">standards</a> should support?
</ul>

<p><a href="https://discuss.okfn.org/c/frictionless-data">Let us know</a>.  We’d love to hear about it.  For examples of what has already been built, see the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tools/">tools</a> page.  For information on where we’re going, see our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/roadmap/">roadmap</a>.</p>

<p>We're also <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2015/01/03/data-curators-wanted-for-core-datasets.html">looking for volunteer "curators"</a> interested in helping us create a set of high quality, useful datasets published as Data Packages.</p>
