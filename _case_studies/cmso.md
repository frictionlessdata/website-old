short_description: "Building standards for cell migration data in order to enable data sharing in the field"

---

## What is the project?

Researchers worldwide try to understand how cells move, a process
extremely important for many physiological and pathological
conditions. [Cell migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration)
is in fact involved in many processes, like wound healing, neuronal
development and cancer invasion. The [CMSO](https://cmso.science/) is
a community building standards for cell migration data, in order to
enable data sharing in the field. The organization has three main
working groups:

- Minimal reporting requirement (developing [MIACME](https://github.com/CellMigStandOrg/MIACME), i.e. the Minimum Information About a Cell Migration Experiment)
- Controlled Vocabularies
- Data Formats and APIs

The last working group is the one where the Data Package
specifications could be used or expanded for the definition of a
standard format and the corresponding libraries to interact with these
standards. In particular, we have started to address the
standardization of cell tracking data.  This is data produced using
tracking software that reconstructs cell movement in time based on
images from a microscope.

## What are the challenges you face working with data?

CMSO deals specifically with cell migration data (a subject of cell
biology). The main challenge lies in the heterogeneity of the
data. This diversity has its origin in two factors:

- **Experimentally**: Cell migration data can be produced using many
  diverse techniques (imaging, non-imaging, dynamic, static,
  high-throughput/screening, etc.)
- **Analytically**: These data are produced using many diverse
  software packages, each of these writing data to specific (sometimes
  proprietary) file formats.

This diversity hampers (or at least makes very difficult) procedures
like meta-analysis, data integration, data mining, and last but not
least, data *reproducibility*.

## How do you use the specs?

CMSO has developed and is about to release the first specification of
a
[Cell Tracking format](https://cellmigstandorg.github.io/Tracks/). This
specification is built on a tabular representation, i.e. data are
stored in tables.  Current v0.1 of this specification can be seen at
[here](https://cellmigstandorg.github.io/Tracks/v0.1/).

CMSO is using the *Tabular* Data Package[^tdp] specification to represent
cell migration-derived tracking data, as illustrated
[here](https://github.com/CellMigStandOrg/biotracks/). The
specification is used for two goals:

1. **Create a Data Package representation** where the data---in our
   case objects (e.g.  cells detected in microscopy images), links,
   and optionally tracks---are stored in CSV files, while metadata and
   schema[^tableschema] information are stored in a JSON file.
1. **Write** this Data Package to a pandas[^pandas] dataframe, to aid quick
   inspection and visualization.

You can see some examples
[here](https://github.com/CellMigStandOrg/biotracks/tree/master/examples).

## How were you made aware of Frictionless Data?

I am an Open Science fan and advocate, so I try to keep up to date
with the initiatives of the
[Open Knowledge International](https://okfn.org) teams. I guess I saw
a tweet and I checked the specs out. Also, CMSO really wanted to keep
a possible specification and file format light and simple. So
different people of the team must have googled for 'CSV and JSON
formats' or something like that, and Frictionless Data popped out :).

## What else would you like to see developed?

That is a nice question. I have opened a couple of issues on the
[GitHub page of the spec](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/specs). The
CMSO is not sure yet if the Data Package representation will be the
one weâ€™ll go for in the very end, because we would first like to know
how sustainable/sustained this spec will be in the future.

## What are the next things you are going to be working on yourself?

CMSO is looking into expanding the
[list of examples](https://github.com/CellMigStandOrg/biotracks/tree/master/examples)
we have so far in terms of tracking software. Personally, I would like
to choose a reference data set (a live-cell, time-lapse microscopy
data set) , and run different cell tracking algorithms/software
packages on it. Then I want to put the results into a common, light
and easy-to-interpret CSV+JSON format (the biotracks format), and show
people how data containerization[^philosophy] can be the way to go to
enable research data exchange and knowledge discovery at large.

## How do these specs compare to others?

Cell tracking data are mostly stored in tabular format, but metadata
are never kept together with the data, which makes data interpretation
and sharing very difficult. The FD specifications take good care of
this aspect. Some other formats are based on XML[^xml] annotation,
which certainly does the job, but are perhaps heavier (even though
perhaps more sustainable in the long term). I hate Excel formats, and
unfortunately I need to parse those too. I love the integration with
Python[^python] and the pandas[^pandas] system, this is a big plus
when doing data science.

## What do you think are some other potential use cases.

As a researcher, I mostly deal with research data. I am pretty sure if
this could work for cell migration data, it could work for many cell
biology disciplines as well.

## Who else do you think we should speak to.

To more researchers! Perhaps to more data producers!
