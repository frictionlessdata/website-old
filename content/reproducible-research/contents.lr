## The Plan

From September 2018 and over a period of three years, the Frictionless Data team will focus on enhanced dissemination and training activities, and further iterations on our [software](https://frictionlessdata.io/software/) and [specifications](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/) via a range of deep [pilot projects](https://frictionlessdata.io/articles/) with research partners.

## FAIR Data

At the onset of this project, we spent time reflecting on [FAIR research principles in relation to Frictionless Data](https://blog.okfn.org/2018/08/14/frictionless-data-and-fair-research-principles/), and expounded on the concept of data packages as an example of FAIRness. [Serah Rono's talk from FORCE 2018](https://youtu.be/3Ranx9Jz0Ro) summarises our work and vision for this project.
