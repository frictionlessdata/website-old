body:

Tabular Data Package is a simple structure for publishing and sharing tabular data with
the following key features:

* **Data** is stored in [CSV (comma separated values)](#csv) files
* **Schema** information about data such as types is stored using [Table Schema](#table-schema)
* **Metadata** both general such as title, author) and the schema information
  is stored in a single JSON file named **datapackage.json** following the
  [Data Package format][dp]

As suggested by the name, Tabular Data Packages extend and specialize the [Data Package][dp] format for the specific case where the data is tabular.

There is a full [RFC-style specification of Tabular Data Package](simple-data-format)
on the Data Protocols website to complement this quick introduction.

### Software
There is a growing set of [online and offline](/software) for working with Tabular Data Packages including tools for creating, viewing and validating.

## Getting Started

Here's an example of a minimal Tabular Data Package dataset:

There are just 2 files, the data file `data.csv` and the `datapackage.json`:

    data.csv
    datapackage.json

data.csv looks like:
```
    var1,var2,var3
    A,1,2.5
    B,3,4.3
```

That is there are 3 fields (columns) and 2 rows of data.

A simple datapackage.json for this data would be:

```json
    {
      "name": "my-dataset",
      # here we list the data files in this dataset
      "resources": [
        {
          "path": "data.csv",
          "schema": {
            "fields": [
              {
                "name": "var1",
                "type": "string"
              },
              {
                "name": "var2",
                "type": "integer"
              },
              {
                "name": "var3",
                "type": "number"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
```

## CSV

CSVs are plain text files with commas separating each column and each row on
one line (normally!). CSVs can be produced and consumed by almost all tools
including spreadsheet programs like Excel and databases like MySQL. Read more
about [CSVs here][csv].

There are a few specific requirements for CSV files in Tabular Data Packages:

* They **must** use the utf-8 character encoding.
* They must be well-formatted - a single header row at the top of the file, no
  blank rows before, within, or after the data rows, etc
* Use "," as the field delimiter unless explicitly stated otherwise

### Delimiters other than Comma

CSV files in Tabular Data Package are not absolutely required to have "," as the
field delimeter - you can use tab, ";" or any other kind of character.

If you do use a delimiter other than "," you must specify the info about the
delimiters in the resource entry using a "dialect" attribute and [CSV Dialect
Description Format][dialect].

Here is an example of how the datapackage.json would look in this case:
```json
    ...
    resources: [
      {
        url:
        dialect: { # as per CSV Dialect specification
          "delimiter": ";"
        },
        schema:  # as per Table Schema
      }
    ]
```

## Table Schema

The schema for each CSV resource follows [Table Schema][ts]. Its purpose
is to provide crucial additional information about the fields (columns) in the
CSV file, most importantly the type (string, number, date etc) of that data.

The structure of the `fields` attribute is an array with each entry being a
field descriptor. Field descriptors look like:

```json
    {
      # required
      "name": "name of field/column (should correspond to field name in data)",

      # not strictly required but strongly recommended
      "type": "A string specifying the data type for data in this field",

      # all of these are optional ...
      "title": "A nicer human readable label or title for the field",
      "format": "A string specifying format of data (e.g. date format)",
      "description": "A description for the field",
      ...
    }
  ```

The Table Schema spec has a [full list of data types that are
supported][ts-types] including string, number, date etc.

## Examples

There are many examples of Tabular Data Packages in the [datasets organization on github][datasets]. Specific examples:

### World GDP

A Data Package which includes the data locally in the repo (data is CSV).

<https://datahub.io/core/gdp>

Here's the `datapackage.json`:

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/datasets/gdp/blob/master/datapackage.json"></script>

### S&P 500 Companies Data

This is an example with more than one resource in the data package.

<https://datahub.io/core/s-and-p-500-companies>

Here's the `datapackage.json`:
