# Frictionless Data

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/frictionlessdata/frictionlessdata.io.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/frictionlessdata/frictionlessdata.io)

Frictionless Data is about removing the friction in working with data. We are doing this by developing a set of tools, standards, and best practices for publishing data. The heart of Frictionless Data is the Data Package standard, a containerization format for any kind of data based on existing practices for publishing open-source software.

This site hosts information about the project, including user stories, guides, and case studies.  For the specifications themselves, please visit:
